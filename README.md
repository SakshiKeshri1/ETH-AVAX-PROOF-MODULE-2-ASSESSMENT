## Railway Ticket Booking System

In this, we have to make a innovative smart contract to show the transaction works by connecting it to the metamask wallet.

## Description

In this, I have used solidity version ^0.8.0 to compile it successfully on Remix IDE. I have also created html, css and js file to make the frontend of the application.
Made the solidity contract file of railway and made different functions for it. Used web3 in it and connected to the metamask wallet for confirmation of transaction.
Used the localhost as network here. In this web app, person can check the availability of the ticket and they can also book and cancel the tickets. If transaction is successful it means the ticket is booked.

## Commands

1. npm install --save hardhat
2. npx hardhat compile
3. npx hardhat node
4. npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Connected with live server to see the frontend
